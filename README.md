## 🎯 Motivation

In OCP’s complex industrial environment, incident management faces several challenges:  
- Scattered information and lack of centralization  
- Difficulty in tracking and analyzing incidents  
- Limited visibility for quick decision-making  

These issues reduce operational efficiency and increase risk.  
**OCP Incident Tracker** addresses these problems by offering a unified, digital, and intelligent platform for incident management.
